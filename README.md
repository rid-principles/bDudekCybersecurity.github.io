# Benjamin Dudek Cybersecurity Project Planner
**Cybrary Notes:**
Research Plan for a Programming Semester Project

**1.  Define the Project Goal**
**Objective: Clarify what the project aims to achieve (e.g., solving a problem, creating a new tool, learning a specific technology).**


I plan to create a website using Github that will have the information I learned through the course at Cybrary and ISC2. There are activities within both courses that will allow me to apply my knowledge and later document it on the website. 

**Steps:
Identify Interests: Choose a topic that excites you or is relevant to your career goals (e.g., web development, AI, game design).**


I am interested in cybersecurity and IT, however, I do not know much about the topic in general and a project would greatly help me expand my knowledge.


**Problem Statement: Formulate a clear problem or opportunity that your project will address.**


I want to create a website that is accessible to everyone who wants to learn more about cybersecurity, as well as document my research and what I learned through the application of this course and possibly various other courses. I also want to receive my certification in cybersecurity as part of my culminating project at the end of year.


**Define Success: Determine what success looks like (e.g., a working prototype, a fully functional application, or a learning outcome).**


Success for me would be the application of the knowledge I acquire from learning the content through the creation of a website and becoming certified in cybersecurity through the exam I plan to take at CLC.

**2.  Conduct Preliminary Research
Objective: Gather information to refine your idea and understand the scope.
Steps:
Literature Review: Look at existing projects or research in your area of interest. Identify gaps or areas for improvement.**


**Technology Exploration: Research the programming languages, frameworks, and tools that might be used in your project.**


**Feasibility Analysis: Assess the complexity of the project. Consider your current skills and time constraints.**


My larger project will consist of small projects and things I have learned from my project on the topic of cybersecurity. I will be doing a lot of my learning through the program, Wireshark, because of its ability to represent learning topics through labs. My project will be fairly complex because of the amount of topics I plan to learn and apply through labs. During the learning at Cybrary and ISC2 to become certified in cybersecurity. I plan to use Cybrary to get the basics of cybersecurity and later on enroll in a practice-based course for six months after which I can take a culminating exam to test my knowledge.


**3.  Define Project Requirements**
**Objective: Outline the technical and functional requirements of the project.**
**Steps:**
**User Stories/Use Cases: Write down the functionalities your project should have (e.g., “As a user, I want to be able to log in securely”).**


**System Requirements: List the technical requirements, including software, hardware, and development environments.**


**Data Requirements: Identify any data sources, databases, or APIs you’ll need.**


I plan to keep track of the topics I have learned through Cybrary and ISC2, and this will help me keep track of what I still need to the learn for the ISC2 certification exam. I will be using Cybrary and applying to various courses throughout my project, as well as ISC2. I also plan to utilize Khan Academy if I need help with the html on my website.(Software for project listed above). Lastly, my goal is to pass the certification exam to become certified in cybersecurity through CLC.


**4.  Develop a Project Timeline**

**Objective: Create a timeline to manage your work throughout the semester.**
**Steps:**


**Break Down Tasks: Divide the project into smaller tasks or milestones (e.g., research, design, development, testing).**


**Set Deadlines: Assign deadlines to each task to keep the project on track.**


**Allocate Time for Learning: Plan time for learning new technologies or concepts.**


Currently, I am enrolled in a 40-hour course for IT and Cybersecurity fundamentals in Cybrary. I plan to utilize all the class time I have available to do work in the course and completing the course should take me about 55 days in total. However, I will take days or part of days to document my progress in between learning days. Essentially, I will be working on my website during my enrollment in the course. I plan to take the certification exam sometime in late March or early April to get my results before the end of the school year.


**5.  Create a Research and Development Plan**
**Objective: Plan how you will approach coding, testing, and validating your project.**
**Steps:**
**Algorithm Design: Plan out the key algorithms or logic you’ll need to implement.**


**Prototyping: Start with a basic prototype or proof of concept to validate your ideas.**


**Testing Strategy: Define how you will test your code (e.g., unit testing, user testing) and what tools you'll use.**


I want to present my information and explain each new concept I learned through the website and its purpose in the field of cybersecurity. Also, I would like to make sure that I learn many of the concepts that are important to know in cybersecurity and IT. I will test my knowledge through the certification and this will give me a chance to prove my knowledge and everything I have learned throughout the school year.


**6.  Document and Present Findings (Using GitHub)
Objective: Maintain a clear and organized record of your research and development process using GitHub, a platform widely used in the software industry for version control and collaboration.
Steps:
Research Log: Create a README.md file in your GitHub repository where you keep notes of all research activities, including sources, findings, and decisions made throughout the project.**


New Github repository was created. Branches for specific needs will be created during the project.


**Code Documentation: Use GitHub to manage your codebase. Make sure to:**


**Commit Regularly: Commit changes frequently with descriptive commit messages to document your progress.**


**Branching: Use branches to manage different features or versions of your project without affecting the main codebase.**


**Pull Requests: If working in a team, use pull requests to review code before merging it into the main branch.**


**Issues and Project Boards: Use GitHub Issues to track tasks and bugs, and Project Boards to organize your workflow.**


**Final Report/Presentation: Utilize GitHub Pages to host your project's final report or create a project wiki directly on GitHub to present your findings, research process, and project outcomes.**


Week 1: Research Plan for a Programming Semester Project

For VR/AR Projects: Detail the environment design, user interaction methods, and the tools or platforms you’ll be utilizing.
Include a basic plan for how you will develop, test, and integrate these elements.


I plan to test my knowledge with the certification exam, however, I will also document the topics I learn through the course at Cybrary and ISC2. I will continue working on the Cybrary course first because it gives a good introduction to the basics of cybersecurity that later the course at ISC2 will help me expand.



4. Development Environment/Setup
Deliverable: Ensure your development environment, hardware setup, or design tools are fully prepared and functional.
Details:
Provide a brief report confirming that all necessary tools, software, libraries, or hardware components are ready.

I can access a textbook from the ISC2 website with free access for 6 months, also I can choose a date for my certification exam at CLC. Also, I have access to Cybrary and Khan Academy and I am currently doing all of my initial learning necessary before enrolling in the course.


5. Initial Development
Deliverable: Begin working on your project and submit an initial version or progress report.
Details:
For Software Projects: Submit an early version of your code with basic functionality.
For Hardware/Robotics Projects: Share initial assembly or configuration of your hardware components.
For VR/AR Projects: Submit an early prototype of your environment or interaction model.
Ensure that your work is well-organized, properly documented, and regularly updated in your GitHub repository (if applicable).


I have started the Cybrary Course and am currently researching how I can study for the certification exam as well as the requirements needed for taking the exam. I plan to have the Cybrary course done in late October or Early November and immediately afterward enroll in the ICS2 course to continue my learning from there. My reports in Github will help me document the knowledge I have acquired to help me study for the certification later on.

# Unit 8
1. Daily Contribution Log
Features/Improvements:
A detailed log of the functionality or improvements made each day, with an explanation of progress on the project’s core features.

October 7th:
Today I asked if I could get VirtualBox installed on the school computer, however it might cause holes in the school network because to run the program you need to reconfigure your network because the 
program creates its own virtual ip address. I also went to IT, but they were having a meeting.

I am going to use VirtualBox for my project because it has all the tools I need to write my linux script and I just need to find software that could allow me to log into my home computer remotely.

I tried options with teamviewer and Anydesk at home, however it would require installation of the programs on the school computer regardless, not solving the problem.

October 8th:

I worked on my lab writeups because I decided I want my project to detect changes in the files of a system, and report them to the user of the system after contacting my mentor.

I created my virtual machine with a 64-bit Linux OS at home, and I added .txt files to a folder created under the name Comp Sci. Projects.

October 9th:

Today I learned the most popular and important Linux commands to use in my Linux script and I started my written report for unit 8 including the purpose of the project.

Also, I learned to how to use the VirtualBox Software on the school computer while connecting remotely to my network. 

October 14th:

I need my own computer's IPV4 address, name assigned, username and password to grant access to my computer through remote desktop.
IPV4 address: 192.168.1.15 and 192.168.56.1
Name: Dudek-PC
Username:Dudek
Password:Dudek2020

School Name: V-0200-02.hs.district128.org

I contacted my mentor and I can use the built-in micrsoft remote desktop connection using either teamviewer or built-in desktop viewer.

Oct. 15th 

I worked on my writeups for the week and I have tried to connect using remote desktop, however I need to make some changes to my permissions on my own computer at my house.

I made changes to the permissions of my computer and I have connected remotely from another computer in my house.

Oct. 16th

I went to IT today and talked about the remote connection from the school computer because it did not allow me to connect remotely to my PC, and I also emailed Mr. Warmbold questions about remote desktop during class.

I updated my writeups saying how the microsoft remote desktop would not work because of the extensive port setup I would have to do. Also, it would not be secure for the VHHS network.

Oct. 17th

I followed up on my emails to Mr. Warmbold from the previous day and asked about other options for accessing my PC from school and I looked into every option during class (zoho assist, amazon web services, and google cloud.

I got help from a student and they suggested installingParsec on my home computer and then access my computer from a browser which I did so at home and I was able to successfully connect my chromebook remotely to my PC.

Code Changes:
Specific updates to the codebase, including commit messages that clearly describe what was changed.
Issues/Resolutions: 

-I accessed the terminal through ubuntu

-I created a script file

-I added a 4 random text files to my created projects folder

Document any bugs or challenges faced during the development process and how they were resolved (or how you plan to resolve them).
Testing Results: 
I could not connect remotely from my home desktop to a chromebook or computer at school and I resolved it by asking around for software that I could use and I was able to successfully connect.

Include results from testing any new features or functionality added this week. Highlight any successful tests or issues discovered.
Screenshots/Demos:
Provide visual evidence of progress, such as screenshots of new features or short video demos.

2. Mentorship Analysis
Mentor Contact Reflection:

My mentor gave me intial ideas for running my desktop remotely instead of actually installing the program on the school computer or chromebook. However, my mentor also helped me refine and pick my project idea because I asked him for personal suggestions through an email correspondence.

Document any interactions with your mentor this week. What feedback did you receive? How has this feedback helped refine your project?
Mentor Feedback Implementation:
Describe how you applied your mentor’s advice. Were there any challenges in implementing this feedback? How did you address them?

I initially tried to download software, but my mentor told me that if I have Windows 10 pro at home I can use a built-in feature to remotely access my desktop. However, it didn't matter in the end because the school does not allow remote access through software, only web-based remote access. This being said, I realized I needed to use web-based remote access and a student helped me out and I made it work.


Next Question for Mentor:
What specific question or area of guidance do you plan to ask your mentor next week? This could involve final tweaks, troubleshooting, or suggestions for improving the user experience.
I want to ask my mentor next week if there are any resources I can use to help me with commands while running my Linux Script. 




3. Timeline Analysis
Completed Tasks:

-Setup remote desktop for working and doing a walkthrough to my project

-Setup virtual machine with 64-bit Linux OS

-Created .txt files that contains random lines of code

-Started Linux Script in Virtual Machine


Summarize your accomplishments since the last submission, especially focusing on the features or milestones reached.
Pending Tasks: Add linux script code for MVP to return boolean if data has been changed.


List what remains to be completed, along with any blockers preventing progress. This includes tasks needed to finish the MVP.
Updated Timeline:

I want to finish a prelminary linux script that will include a return boolean that will evaluate the similarity of the old data compared to the changed data.
Adjust your overall project timeline based on the progress made this week. Include a plan for how you will stay on track for the MVP submission on 11/1.

MVP Progress & Plan
Now that I have gotten the remote desktop to work I am able to spend more class time working on my actual project instead of diagnosing problems along the way. This being said, I will have the next two weeks in class to finish my script and provided I utilize my time in class, I will be able to finish it and have more than enough time to test it as well.



4.MVP Progress & Plan 

    Core Features Expected in the MVP:
    Provide a brief description of the key features that you plan to have working by 11/1 for your Minimal Viable Product (MVP).
    Explain any challenges you foresee in implementing these features and how you plan to overcome them.
    
    I want to implement a Linux script that a user can run to check if there have been changes to data in a folder. 
    For example, it will run a script using what the data in a file was and compare it to what it currently is and it 
    will determine if it is different. It will initially only return a boolean of true/false whether or not the data in a file
    has been changed.
    Bug Report:
    
    Document any known bugs or issues that need to be addressed before the MVP submission. Provide a plan for resolving these.
    I have not had any issues yet, however if I have any issues during the next week when preparing my MVP, I will address those
    in the log.
    
    Testing Plan:
    Describe how you plan to test the MVP in the coming weeks. Include details on peer testing or feedback you’ll seek.
    I will make changes to a file and then run my script to see if the script recognizes the data has been changed and will return 
    true and false, and later I might try to add what file has been changed and how.

Unit 9: MVP Finalization and Testing (Due: 10/28)(See below)
Objective:
By the end of this week, your MVP should be nearly complete and tested. You'll also need to be well-prepared for the demo and submission on 11/1. The focus will be on finalizing core features, conducting thorough testing, and implementing feedback from peers and mentors.
Code Refinement and Final Feature Adjustments
-My project will tell the user about whether or not there are duplicate text files on the user's system.
Core Feature Refinement: Focus on polishing your core features. Prioritize resolving any major issues affecting usability.
Last-Minute Improvements: Allocate time for final adjustments to features or functionality that are nearly complete.
Deliverables:
Feature Checklist Update: Create an updated checklist of what’s done and what needs final refinement for the MVP.
Checklist: 
-Loops for testing
-Variables and exported
-if statements for testing
I still need to:
Setup parameters correctly
Clean up output a little more
Daily Contribution Log: Continue logging contributions and improvements.

Oct. 21
-I created my general outine for loops and if statements I wanted to include in my linux script.
-Also, I was able to format all the loops and if statements correctly using the loops to run 16 times and return the correct statement.

Oct. 22
-I emailed John with a questions about using the grep command and how I could utilize it to compare files in my project, however he let me know that I can use commands such as diff, cmp, or comm to compare one file to another instead.
I applied this into my project and successfully used my loops and if statements to compare files using the diff command instead of the grep command.

Oct. 23
-I worked on the peer editing with Zoe and I got useful feedback and afterwards I included the feedback in my writeups for the week
-I worked on my writeups for the week after peer testing and I what I worked on so far, and what I still had to do.

Oct. 24
-I emailed John about whether or not there are ways to compare the old version of a file with a new version of the file, and John sent me a very useful command checker that I could use with diff to evaluate the diff command and echo statements based on the result.
-I implemented the command checker into my code and I was able to get different outputs based on the relations the files had with each other.

Oct. 25
- I did my testing and I found I was very successful in the things I had done this week because I found that I only had two bugs to fix before the MVP submission because I need to create a more clear echo statement for the user and I need to pass the files as parameters using the file types as a parameter for the loop.
- Overall, I fixed a lot of things this week that have greatly brought me closer to the MVP submission and demo on Friday, but I still have things I need to fix beforehand.


Peer Testing and Feedback Collection
Peer Testing: Participate in peer testing sessions by demoing your MVP to classmates. Focus on testing usability, finding bugs, and offering feedback on any confusing or underdeveloped areas.
Bug Discovery: Document all bugs or issues encountered during peer testing.
Feedback for Zoe-Web page doesn’t keep track of the amount of things that are still in stock for the nonprofit it is being made for.
You have to press go to checkout multiple times before actually going there, the total is not correct at the end.
Feedback for Ben-It is not easy for the user to read and understand what changes have occurred to the files.
I need to include more messages to the user about which files are the same and which files are different for the script to be more user friendly.
Deliverables:
Bug List and Feedback Summary: Create a list of discovered bugs and any feedback received from peers. Include a plan for addressing critical bugs by 11/1.
-I included more echo files that can give the user feedback and information on each file and its relation to the other text files in the system in my if statements.
-The files are timestamped so the user can see exactly when the last edits were made to the file.


Mentor Check-In and Testing Refinement
Mentor Contact: Reach out to your mentor with any final questions. Seek guidance on unresolved issues or feedback on your progress.
Testing Focus: Refine your testing process, including testing edge cases and addressing critical bugs found during peer testing.
Deliverables:
Mentor Feedback Reflection: Document the advice you received from your mentor and how you plan to implement it.
- I asked my mentor for help on how I could try to implement searching for whether or not files are the same or not using a command called grep, however my mentor directed me to a command called diff which essentially evaluates an entire text file as a whole compared to another text file instead.
- I also asked my mentor if there are ways I can compare a file that was edited to its original version and John helped me out with a checker if statement to check the output of the previous diff command I used.
Bug Fixes Progress: Provide updates on which bugs were fixed and which ones remain as blockers.
I was able to include a message at the beginning that is describing what the purpose of the script is and what it will do.
I was able to see timestamps of the files and send it back to the user as information
I still have a bug where it returns a true or false statement after every time it checks a file instead of after it is done comparing 1 file to the other 3.
My script still checks the data of the text file with itself, it should only check 12 times if there are 4 text files on the system.

Final Testing and Documentation Prep
Final Testing: Conduct final rounds of testing for critical features to ensure the MVP is functional for the demo.
Documentation Review: Finalize your README or project documentation for the MVP submission. Ensure that setup instructions and feature descriptions are clear.
Deliverables:
![compSciMVPic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41f1054f-5af1-4ec7-ae3a-19994055bfac)
Testing Summary: Include a final summary of testing results, focusing on successful tests and remaining issues (if any).
I was able to successfully test and access all of the files I wanted to use in my project, and all my loops and if statements worked because in total I got 16 outputs which means every file was checked. My goal is to eliminate 4 times they are checked with themselves to be more efficient and give the user a better experience interpreting the script output. Overall, it was a successful test and I know exactly what I need to work on and get done before Friday.
Documentation Submission: Ensure all documentation, including setup instructions, is finalized and ready for submission on 11/1.
Setup Instructions for project: 
1. Use link to parsec: web.parsec.app
2. Right click and open in terminal
3. Once in the terminal, run the script by typing "./compSciScript.sh" 
4. Look at the output and see what files are similar and which ones are different
5. Go into myFiles and change text files or make one identical to another and run the script using the same command and see what has changed and what files are the same

# Unit 10

My project's overall goal is to use my script to evaluate whether text files are duplicates of each other. I want to solve the problem of not being able to check what text files are the same on a Linux system using ubuntu because there is no one command to evaluate a directory for duplicate text files. 

Checklist of primary features implemented: 

Allowing the addition of new text files at any time to the system and they will be evaluated compared to the other files when the script is run again. 

	-Using two for loops with a staggered starting point in the script of my 
	comparingFile allows for evaluation of all the text file with one another.

Outputting the differences between the files, if they are not evaluated as duplicates, the names of the files, and the date of when the last time the .txt file was last modified

	-Use of the diff command and the checker statement that sees if the two files contain different text.

Outputting to the user the name of both files that have been evaluated as duplicates of each other

	-Use of if statements after the diff evaluation that access the variables' values to output back to the user.

Features to implement for final submission 

	-Option for user to delete duplicate files using a user-friendly prompt after the script has run
 
	-If user answers yes, another prompt will ask the user which duplicate of the file they want to delete. 
  
	-Fix errors that can occur while looping through files that don't exist once the 
 	value of comparingFile gets higher than the length of the array-1.

        -I might add other features as I move closer to the final project submission, if this does 
	occur I will make sure to document those features thouroughly in my final submission.
   

I have 5 text files on my ubuntu system and they all have been randomized and I modified files 1 and 4 so they would be the same.

FileOne.txt: Duplicate jargon of 4

FileTwo.txt: No duplicates

FileThree.txt: Duplicate "normal" text of 5

FileFour.txt: Duplicate jargon of 1

FileFive.txt: Duplicate "normal" text of 3

Script: 

Located on my Virtual Ubuntu system, I will show the code during the presentation briefly to showcase the loops.

# Unit 11

-My mentor suggested that I implement a feature to make my project have a more viable problem to solve using my script and advance my project. My mentor suggested that I use the script to parse through fake emails to determine if they contain any PII (Personal Identifiable Information) that generally should not be contained inside an email. For example, an email from an employee to a client should not contain their social security number.

-Also, my mentor suggested that I make the information returned by the script more valuable to the average user. 

Action Plan:

Week 1: Create all the files and folders necessary for the script to run through all of the files and cross-reference it with the SSN's in the employeeList file. Create general structure for the entire script using grep and diff in conujunction. 

(Wednesday:Work on writeups after meeting with mentor and outline for script) 

(Thursday: Create fake email files and play around with the grep command and the types of extensions in my script) 

(Friday: Try to implement the read command to prompt the user for input within the script)

Week 2: Work on implementing the grep command completely into the first part of my script and adding files that contain SSN from the organization into an array (Monday-Wednesday)

Make sure the loop in the first part of the script checks all of the files I need it to check and debug (Thursday)

Work on writeups at the end of the week Friday and adjust plan for next week accordingly (Friday)

Week 3: Work on refining my MVP submission to work along with the grep part of the script (Monday-Wednesday)

Check the second loop is adding the duplicates or forwarded emails to the same array from the first part of the script (Thursday)

Work on writeups at the end of the week Friday and adjust plan for next week accordingly(Friday)

Week 4: Work on the prompts for the user at the end of each part of the script to give the user an option to add each file that contains a SSN from the company or a duplicate email that has been forwarded using the read command (Monday-Thursday)

Work on writeups at the end of the week Friday and adjust plan for next week accordingly(Friday)

Week 5: Run using the test cases below and do a bug report to make address issues before my final submission. (Monday)

Make changes to the script based on the bug report from Monday (Tuesday->Submission day)

emailFive.txt: Contains the SSN of one of the people in the company 

emailFour.txt: Does not contain any social security numbers

emailOne.txt: Contains a random SSN that is not anyone's in the company

emailThree.txt: Duplicate of emailOne

emailTwo.txt: Duplicate of emailFive

Daily Log:

Nov. 6th

Worked on writeups after meeeting with my mentor Monday (20 min)

I created a new text file that would contain employee's social security numbers and the names that are associated with them (5 min)

I made an outline for what I wanted my script to do for my final project (down below) (20 min)

I am not exactly sure if I want to include the loop to check for the duplicates before or after the script checks for the social security number within the files.

I need to figure out the order tomorrow to finish my outline.

Nov. 7th 

Worked on creating 5 fake emails to use in the script to contain social security numbers (20 min)

I worked on implementing the grep command into my script to search for the social security numbers from the employeeList file within all of the emails (25 min)

I ran into the issue of how I want implement the same array in both loops to add all the necessary files that are to be flagged.

I realized today that using the grep command with the proper extension is very efficient at searching each lines of a files recursively for a pattern or keyword.

Nov 8th 

Worked on the user's availability to make decisions based on the running of the script using the read command that can take input(35 min)

I worked on my writeups for my project to describe what I hope to accomplish next week in class and I also want to ask my mentor next week in an email as to how I can try to format the report for the user when it comes time to do this (10 min)

I had good success with the read command today because of the way I was able to implement the read command to ask the user for input.

Nov 11th 

I commented out the second part of the loop which contains the diff command to work on the making the grep command work with the fake emails and the employeeList file. (45 min)

I had trouble using a command checker or something that can evaluate what the result of the grep command is and how I can use that information to add a file containing an SSN to my flaggedList array.

I might try use an if statement to check whether or not the grep command found the SSN of any employee in any file.

Outline for final project:

run grep

add ones containing SSN to array

run diff

add ones containing SSN and duplicates to final array to return information to the user in a report format.

Written plan for structure in week 2: 

Use current structure and utilize grep to evaluate each file for whether or not PII is contained in the email file of every employee in my company.

Check if the emails are the same and then return to the user how there is a high chance the email has been forwarded or copied and give option to report or flag as well.

if statement for the user at the very end to answer whether they would like to log the email in a flagged folder section or move onto the next email if the issue has already been resolved.

The file will named and stored in a folder on the same directory if the user selects yes, and if no it asks the user for the next file that contains PII, and if no other files contain PII the script terminates.

After all the files that the user has decided need to be stored they can also decide whether they want to view the entire log to get a rundown of what information has been shared through emails.

# Unit 12

Timeline Reorganization (Day 1)

I have created all of the files necessary for the script and the planned structure for the grep and the diff part of the script. 

I need to revisit how my diff command will work because I only want it to go through the files that have not yet been flagged through the first part of the script. 

Monday: Work on the timeline reorganization and decide what extension to use with grep to return the files that contain social security numbers 

Tuesday: Change loops to integrate using the employeeList to check every single other file.

Wednesday: Test using all of the email files and debug if necessary.

Thursday: Check the second loop is adding the duplicates or forwarded emails to the same array from the first part of the script

Friday: Finish writeups and plan for how I need to fix the diff part of my script to work with the grep part. 

Week 1: Create all the files and folders necessary for the script to run through all of the files and cross-reference it with the SSN's in the employeeList file. Create general structure for the entire script using grep and diff in conujunction. 

(Wednesday:Work on writeups after meeting with mentor and outline for script) 

(Thursday: Create fake email files and play around with the grep command and the types of extensions in my script) 

(Friday: Try to implement the read command to prompt the user for input within the script)

Week 2: Work on implementing the grep command completely into the first part of my script and adding files that contain SSN from the organization into an array (Monday-Wednesday)

Make sure the loop in the first part of the script checks all of the files I need it to check and debug (Thursday)

Work on writeups at the end of the week Friday and adjust plan for next week accordingly (Friday)

Week 3: Work on refining my MVP submission to work along with the grep part of the script (Monday-Wednesday)

Check the second loop is adding the duplicates or forwarded emails to the same array from the first part of the script (Thursday)

Work on writeups at the end of the week Friday and adjust plan for next week accordingly(Friday)

Week 4: Work on the prompts for the user at the end of each part of the script to give the user an option to add each file that contains a SSN from the company or a duplicate email that has been forwarded using the read command (Monday-Thursday)

Work on writeups at the end of the week Friday and adjust plan for next week accordingly(Friday)

Week 5: Run using the test cases below and do a bug report to make address issues before my final submission. (Monday)

Make changes to the script based on the bug report from Monday (Tuesday->Submission day)

2. My mentor suggested I take my project to the next level and use my script to check for employees SSN's leaked in company emails. I will try to implement the grep command along with the diff command to first check if the file contains a SSN from a member of the organization to then check if there are any emails that could be exactly like it to see if it has been forwarded to anyone else. Afterwards, the user can add the emails to a flagged list at their own discretion and choose to view a flaggedList report based on whether or not there were any things added to the list while the script was running.

3. Daily Log 

Monday Nov. 11th

Worked on the timeline reorganization(20 min) and I tried not using any extension with the grep command because I only needed to access the text version of the file and compare it with the employeeList and it will return 0 if there are any instances of any social security number in the fake email (25 min).

I was not able to return the correct files that contained the PII of the employees because I need to use different extensions. I did not take a screenshot today because I only experimented with the extensions with grep and it was very similar to the grep command in Tuesday's iamge.

Tuesday Nov. 12th
Tried to implement different types of extensions with the grep command to check for the SSN between the employee list and an email (15 min)
I also researched how the input had to be different depending on the extension of the grep command, and I figured out if I wanted to use grep -q I needed to have a checker statement right after the loop ran. (25 min)
I adjusted my employeeList file so it would only contain one employee's SSN per line

Wednesday, Nov. 13th
I started changing my script to include read commands in the first part to ask the user if they want to see the report log and take a look at what is there before running the second part of the script. The idea is to make it as user friendly as possible and I might even inlcude an option for the user to clear the flaggedList of maybe even save it. However, I am not sure how practical saving it as another file would be for my purposes (35 min)

I am learning how to prompt the user for an answer in a specific format so the script does not end on the user side because the user types "Yes" or "y" instead of "yes" (10 min).

Thursday Nov. 14th
I took a break from the grep command and worked on changing my previous part of the script to do check for duplicates of the remaining files that were searched through in the previous part of the script. (40 min)

I also worked on my writeups for the week (5 min)

Friday Nov. 15th

I figured out I have to use the -q extension with grep to make sure the output of the command is a number and not a string of identical strings or lines(15 min)
I also need to combine commands, for example, you can do grep -q -w which will silence the output of grep and also search for entire words only which is what I will use in my script(10 min).
I emailed my mentor on help on how to implement the grep command using different extensions and I was able to experiment with the extensions at home to only add the emails containing company PII to the array using a combination of the -q -f extension with grep.(20min)

# Unit 13

Timeline Organization:

Tuesday, Nov. 19th:
-Finalize grep part of the script including read commands and adding the emails containing PII to the flaggedList array.
Wednesday, Nov. 19th:
-Start the finalizing parts of the diff part of the script that will allow the user to add duplicated or forwarded emails to a separate array at their discretion and then a compilation of the flaggedList and forwardedList at the end of the script and an option for the user to view it. Specifically, the read command allowing for user interaction.
Thursday, Nov. 19th:
Work on the formatting for returning the report at the end of script specifying what is flagged and what was duplicated/forwarded.
Friday, Nov. 19th:
Add useful information to the report today to supplement the messages to the user such as the email content itself for viewing, and this info will help identify compared to the employee List, whose SSN has been shared.

Week 2: Work on refining my MVP submission to work along with the grep part of the script (Monday-Wednesday)

Check the second loop is adding the duplicates or forwarded emails to a different array from the first part of the script (Thursday)

Work on writeups at the end of the week Friday and adjust plan for next week accordingly(Friday)

Week 3: Work on the prompts for the user at the end of each part of the script to give the user an option to add each file that contains a SSN from the company or a duplicate email that has been forwarded using the read command (Monday-Thursday)

Work on writeups at the end of the week Friday and adjust plan for next week accordingly(Friday)

Week 4: Add a feature that can allow the user to add the people who have sent the emails with SSN's to a flaggedList to keep for HR in a company and detail what has happened so the proper actions can be taken.

Week 5: Run using the test cases below and do a bug report to make address issues before my final submission. (Monday)

Make changes to the script based on the bug report from Monday (Tuesday->Submission day)

Daily Log:

Tuesday, Nov. 19th

Focused on the read commands in the diff part of my script to parse through incorrect inputs by the user for example if the user inputs "yes" or "Yes" instead of y which is the designated character the script will work with. (25 min) 
I worked on the part of the script that deleted the last part of the array which is the employeeList file so it doesn't check the employeeList with itself. (10 min).
Need to work on the writeups for the timeline for this week and the rest of the semester (10 min)

Thursday, Nov. 21st

-Worked on adding the duplicate files to a duplicateList array and returning the list to the user along with the flaggedList array (25 min)
-Learned how to utilize the readarray command to actually add the file contents to the array instead of just the file name itself (20 min)
-I need to start brainstorming other features to add to my script since I have some extra time left.

Friday, Nov. 22nd

Worked on using the readarray command in the diff part of the script so it actually returns the files contents to the user instead of the file name (10 min)
My mentor hasn't gotten back to me this week, however I asked Juno to give me some feedback and advice for my project currently (5 min)
Worked on the timeline readjustment and the writeups for this week based on the feedback, advice and ideas Juno gave me through my mini-presentation (30 min)

Juno:
cool thing: The script has the ability to parse through files and compared them using the diff and grep commands.
some advice: add more features for info detection that can even detect information such as the employee's addresses.

Planned addition: Add a feature that can check for the employee's addresses contained in the emails in conjunction with the social security numbers
I will definitely work on implementing different features for next week such as address detection as well which can change the entire output of the script in as well because it will have to check the emails all over again for addresses. I have a little more than three weeks left to implement this feature into my script and I have been currently testing and adjusting the output of my script which I planned to do later. This being said I have a lot of extra time for this and I also want to add more options and features for the user to make better use of the interface.
