# Benjamin Dudek Cybersecurity Project Planner
**Cybrary Notes:**
Research Plan for a Programming Semester Project

**1.  Define the Project Goal**
**Objective: Clarify what the project aims to achieve (e.g., solving a problem, creating a new tool, learning a specific technology).**


I plan to create a website using Github that will have the information I learned through the course at Cybrary and ISC2. There are activities within both courses that will allow me to apply my knowledge and later document it on the website. 


**Steps:
Identify Interests: Choose a topic that excites you or is relevant to your career goals (e.g., web development, AI, game design).**


I am interested in cybersecurity and IT, however, I do not know much about the topic in general and a project would greatly help me expand my knowledge.


**Problem Statement: Formulate a clear problem or opportunity that your project will address.**


I want to create a website that is accessible to everyone who wants to learn more about cybersecurity, as well as document my research and what I learned through the application of this course and possibly various other courses. I also want to receive my certification in cybersecurity as part of my culminating project at the end of year.


**Define Success: Determine what success looks like (e.g., a working prototype, a fully functional application, or a learning outcome).**


Success for me would be the application of the knowledge I acquire from learning the content through the creation of a website and becoming certified in cybersecurity through the exam I plan to take at CLC.

**2.  Conduct Preliminary Research
Objective: Gather information to refine your idea and understand the scope.
Steps:
Literature Review: Look at existing projects or research in your area of interest. Identify gaps or areas for improvement.**


**Technology Exploration: Research the programming languages, frameworks, and tools that might be used in your project.**


**Feasibility Analysis: Assess the complexity of the project. Consider your current skills and time constraints.**


My larger project will consist of small projects and things I have learned from my project on the topic of cybersecurity. I will be doing a lot of my learning through the program, Wireshark, because of its ability to represent learning topics through labs. My project will be fairly complex because of the amount of topics I plan to learn and apply through labs. During the learning at Cybrary and ISC2 to become certified in cybersecurity. I plan to use Cybrary to get the basics of cybersecurity and later on enroll in a practice-based course for six months after which I can take a culminating exam to test my knowledge.


**3.  Define Project Requirements**
**Objective: Outline the technical and functional requirements of the project.**
**Steps:**
**User Stories/Use Cases: Write down the functionalities your project should have (e.g., “As a user, I want to be able to log in securely”).**


**System Requirements: List the technical requirements, including software, hardware, and development environments.**


**Data Requirements: Identify any data sources, databases, or APIs you’ll need.**


I plan to keep track of the topics I have learned through Cybrary and ISC2, and this will help me keep track of what I still need to the learn for the ISC2 certification exam. I will be using Cybrary and applying to various courses throughout my project, as well as ISC2. I also plan to utilize Khan Academy if I need help with the html on my website.(Software for project listed above). Lastly, my goal is to pass the certification exam to become certified in cybersecurity through CLC.


**4.  Develop a Project Timeline**
**Objective: Create a timeline to manage your work throughout the semester.**
**Steps:**


**Break Down Tasks: Divide the project into smaller tasks or milestones (e.g., research, design, development, testing).**


**Set Deadlines: Assign deadlines to each task to keep the project on track.**


**Allocate Time for Learning: Plan time for learning new technologies or concepts.**


Currently, I am enrolled in a 40-hour course for IT and Cybersecurity fundamentals in Cybrary. I plan to utilize all the class time I have available to do work in the course and completing the course should take me about 55 days in total. However, I will take days or part of days to document my progress in between learning days. Essentially, I will be working on my website during my enrollment in the course. I plan to take the certification exam sometime in late March or early April to get my results before the end of the school year.


**5.  Create a Research and Development Plan**
**Objective: Plan how you will approach coding, testing, and validating your project.**
**Steps:**
**Algorithm Design: Plan out the key algorithms or logic you’ll need to implement.**


**Prototyping: Start with a basic prototype or proof of concept to validate your ideas.**


**Testing Strategy: Define how you will test your code (e.g., unit testing, user testing) and what tools you'll use.**


I want to present my information and explain each new concept I learned through the website and its purpose in the field of cybersecurity. Also, I would like to make sure that I learn many of the concepts that are important to know in cybersecurity and IT. I will test my knowledge through the certification and this will give me a chance to prove my knowledge and everything I have learned throughout the school year.


**6.  Document and Present Findings (Using GitHub)
Objective: Maintain a clear and organized record of your research and development process using GitHub, a platform widely used in the software industry for version control and collaboration.
Steps:
Research Log: Create a README.md file in your GitHub repository where you keep notes of all research activities, including sources, findings, and decisions made throughout the project.**


New Github repository was created. Branches for specific needs will be created during the project.


**Code Documentation: Use GitHub to manage your codebase. Make sure to:**


**Commit Regularly: Commit changes frequently with descriptive commit messages to document your progress.**


**Branching: Use branches to manage different features or versions of your project without affecting the main codebase.**


**Pull Requests: If working in a team, use pull requests to review code before merging it into the main branch.**


**Issues and Project Boards: Use GitHub Issues to track tasks and bugs, and Project Boards to organize your workflow.**


**Final Report/Presentation: Utilize GitHub Pages to host your project's final report or create a project wiki directly on GitHub to present your findings, research process, and project outcomes.**

For VR/AR Projects: Detail the environment design, user interaction methods, and the tools or platforms you’ll be utilizing.
Include a basic plan for how you will develop, test, and integrate these elements.


I plan to test my knowledge with the certification exam, however, I will also document the topics I learn through the course at Cybrary and ISC2. I will continue working on the Cybrary course first because it gives a good introduction to the basics of cybersecurity that later the course at ISC2 will help me expand.



4. Development Environment/Setup
Deliverable: Ensure your development environment, hardware setup, or design tools are fully prepared and functional.
Details:
Provide a brief report confirming that all necessary tools, software, libraries, or hardware components are ready.

I can access a textbook from the ISC2 website with free access for 6 months, also I can choose a date for my certification exam at CLC. Also, I have access to Cybrary and Khan Academy and I am currently doing all of my initial learning necessary before enrolling in the course.


5. Initial Development
Deliverable: Begin working on your project and submit an initial version or progress report.
Details:
For Software Projects: Submit an early version of your code with basic functionality.
For Hardware/Robotics Projects: Share initial assembly or configuration of your hardware components.
For VR/AR Projects: Submit an early prototype of your environment or interaction model.
Ensure that your work is well-organized, properly documented, and regularly updated in your GitHub repository (if applicable).


I have started the Cybrary Course and am currently researching how I can study for the certification exam as well as the requirements needed for taking the exam. I plan to have the Cybrary course done in late October or Early November and immediately afterward enroll in the ICS2 course to continue my learning from there. My reports in Github will help me document the knowledge I have acquired to help me study for the certification later on.

# Unit 8
1. Daily Contribution Log
Features/Improvements:
A detailed log of the functionality or improvements made each day, with an explanation of progress on the project’s core features.

October 7th:
Today I asked if I could get VirtualBox installed on the school computer, however it might cause holes in the school network because to run the program you need to reconfigure your network because the 
program creates its own virtual ip address. I also went to IT, but they were having a meeting.

I am going to use VirtualBox for my project because it has all the tools I need to write my linux script and I just need to find software that could allow me to log into my home computer remotely.

I tried options with teamviewer and Anydesk at home, however it would require installation of the programs on the school computer regardless, not solving the problem.

October 8th:

I worked on my lab writeups because I decided I want my project to detect changes in the files of a system, and report them to the user of the system after contacting my mentor.

I created my virtual machine with a 64-bit Linux OS at home, and I added .txt files to a folder created under the name Comp Sci. Projects.

October 9th:

Today I learned the most popular and important Linux commands to use in my Linux script and I started my written report for unit 8 including the purpose of the project.

Also, I learned to how to use the VirtualBox Software on the school computer while connecting remotely to my network. 

October 14th:

I need my own computer's IPV4 address, name assigned, username and password to grant access to my computer through remote desktop.
IPV4 address: 192.168.1.15 and 192.168.56.1
Name: Dudek-PC
Username:Dudek
Password:Dudek2020

School Name: V-0200-02.hs.district128.org

I contacted my mentor and I can use the built-in micrsoft remote desktop connection using either teamviewer or built-in desktop viewer.

Oct. 15th 

I worked on my writeups for the week and I have tried to connect using remote desktop, however I need to make some changes to my permissions on my own computer at my house.

I made changes to the permissions of my computer and I have connected remotely from another computer in my house.

Oct. 16th

I went to IT today and talked about the remote connection from the school computer because it did not allow me to connect remotely to my PC, and I also emailed Mr. Warmbold questions about remote desktop during class.

I updated my writeups saying how the microsoft remote desktop would not work because of the extensive port setup I would have to do. Also, it would not be secure for the VHHS network.

Oct. 17th

I followed up on my emails to Mr. Warmbold from the previous day and asked about other options for accessing my PC from school and I looked into every option during class (zoho assist, amazon web services, and google cloud.

I got help from a student and they suggested installingParsec on my home computer and then access my computer from a browser which I did so at home and I was able to successfully connect my chromebook remotely to my PC.

Code Changes:
Specific updates to the codebase, including commit messages that clearly describe what was changed.
Issues/Resolutions: 

-I accessed the terminal through ubuntu

-I created a script file

-I added a 4 random text files to my created projects folder

Document any bugs or challenges faced during the development process and how they were resolved (or how you plan to resolve them).
Testing Results: 
I could not connect remotely from my home desktop to a chromebook or computer at school and I resolved it by asking around for software that I could use and I was able to successfully connect.

Include results from testing any new features or functionality added this week. Highlight any successful tests or issues discovered.
Screenshots/Demos:
Provide visual evidence of progress, such as screenshots of new features or short video demos.

2. Mentorship Analysis
Mentor Contact Reflection:

My mentor gave me intial ideas for running my desktop remotely instead of actually installing the program on the school computer or chromebook. However, my mentor also helped me refine and pick my project idea because I asked him for personal suggestions through an email correspondence.

Document any interactions with your mentor this week. What feedback did you receive? How has this feedback helped refine your project?
Mentor Feedback Implementation:
Describe how you applied your mentor’s advice. Were there any challenges in implementing this feedback? How did you address them?

I initially tried to download software, but my mentor told me that if I have Windows 10 pro at home I can use a built-in feature to remotely access my desktop. However, it didn't matter in the end because the school does not allow remote access through software, only web-based remote access. This being said, I realized I needed to use web-based remote access and a student helped me out and I made it work.


Next Question for Mentor:
What specific question or area of guidance do you plan to ask your mentor next week? This could involve final tweaks, troubleshooting, or suggestions for improving the user experience.
I want to ask my mentor next week if there are any resources I can use to help me with commands while running my Linux Script. 




3. Timeline Analysis
Completed Tasks:

-Setup remote desktop for working and doing a walkthrough to my project

-Setup virtual machine with 64-bit Linux OS

-Created .txt files that contains random lines of code

-Started Linux Script in Virtual Machine


Summarize your accomplishments since the last submission, especially focusing on the features or milestones reached.
Pending Tasks: Add linux script code for MVP to return boolean if data has been changed.


List what remains to be completed, along with any blockers preventing progress. This includes tasks needed to finish the MVP.
Updated Timeline:

I want to finish a prelminary linux script that will include a return boolean that will evaluate the similarity of the old data compared to the changed data.
Adjust your overall project timeline based on the progress made this week. Include a plan for how you will stay on track for the MVP submission on 11/1.

MVP Progress & Plan
Now that I have gotten the remote desktop to work I am able to spend more class time working on my actual project instead of diagnosing problems along the way. This being said, I will have the next two weeks in class to finish my script and provided I utilize my time in class, I will be able to finish it and have more than enough time to test it as well.



4.MVP Progress & Plan 

    Core Features Expected in the MVP:
    Provide a brief description of the key features that you plan to have working by 11/1 for your Minimal Viable Product (MVP).
    Explain any challenges you foresee in implementing these features and how you plan to overcome them.
    
    I want to implement a Linux script that a user can run to check if there have been changes to data in a folder. 
    For example, it will run a script using what the data in a file was and compare it to what it currently is and it 
    will determine if it is different. It will initially only return a boolean of true/false whether or not the data in a file
    has been changed.
    Bug Report:
    
    Document any known bugs or issues that need to be addressed before the MVP submission. Provide a plan for resolving these.
    I have not had any issues yet, however if I have any issues during the next week when preparing my MVP, I will address those
    in the log.
    
    Testing Plan:
    Describe how you plan to test the MVP in the coming weeks. Include details on peer testing or feedback you’ll seek.
    I will make changes to a file and then run my script to see if the script recognizes the data has been changed and will return 
    true and false, and later I might try to add what file has been changed and how.
