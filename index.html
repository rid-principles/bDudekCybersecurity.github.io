    <h3>- Network Reference Models  -Finished</h3>

        <p>-I learned the layers in the TCP/IP and OSP models and how they can be used to represent order in which items are sent and received over the internet</p>
        <p>-The TCP/IP model consists of 7 layers of sending and receiving packets</p>
        <p>-The OSP model is a more condensed version of TCP/IP model consisting of only 4 layers</p>
        <p>-The exact same steps are followed in the sending and receiving of packets, except the order changes</p>
        <p>-Lab finished</p>

            <h2>Mentorship Analysis:</h2>
            
            <h3>Mentor Contact Reflection:</h3>

            <h3>What was the first question you asked your mentor this week?</h3>

            <p>The first question I asked my mentor this week was whether the current resource I am using is good for getting the certification in cybersecurity. However, I later found out the answer to my planned first question because John has a CompTIA Security+ sy0-701 certification.</p>

            <h3>ummarize the response from your mentor and analyze how it helps you improve your project. Did it address the challenge? What actions did you take based on the feedback?</h3>

            <p>The response from my mentor helped me improve my project because I got some valuable feedback about the certification I should to take and the resources I should be using. I didn't think my question about whether or not he was certified in cybersecurity was as important as which resources I should or should not be using.</p>

            <h3>Follow-up: How did you use your mentor's guidance to progress in your project? Document how you applied the advice or plan to in the coming week.</h3>

            <p>I used my mentor's guidance to adjust my project goal from getting a certification for certified in cybersecurity to getting a CompTIA Security+ certification because it is the benchmark for many security positions in the field.</p>

            <h3>Timeline:</h3>

            <p>I plan to complete the course in about 90-120 days for newer students. This means I should do 30-45 minutes of the course per day, and I should also save some time at the end of class for documentation of work.  I will take a test at the end of the course and it will give me a score that either qualifies me for the certification or doesn't.</p>

            Unit 8 Deliverables (Due 10/18)
            
1. Daily Contribution Log
Features/Improvements:
A detailed log of the functionality or improvements made each day, with an explanation of progress on the project’s core features.

October 7th:
Today I asked if I could get VirtualBox installed on the school computer, however it might cause holes in the school network because to run the program you need to reconfigure your network because the 
program creates its own virtual ip address. I also went to IT, but they were having a meeting.

I am going to use VirtualBox for my project because it has all the tools I need to write my linux script and I just need to find software that could allow me to log into my home computer remotely.

I tried options with teamviewer and Anydesk at home, however it would require installation of the programs on the school computer regardless, not solving the problem.

October 8th:

I worked on my lab writeups because I decided I want my project to detect changes in the files of a system, and report them to the user of the system after contacting my mentor.

I created my virtual machine with a 64-bit Linux OS at home, and I added .txt files to a folder created under the name Comp Sci. Projects.

October 9th:

Today I learned the most popular and important Linux commands to use in my Linux script and I started my written report for unit 8 including the purpose of the project.

Also, I learned to how to use the VirtualBox Software on the school computer while connecting remotely to my network. 

October 14th:

I need my own computer's IPV4 address, name assigned, username and password to grant access to my computer through remote desktop.
IPV4 address: 192.168.1.15 and 192.168.56.1
Name: Dudek-PC
Username:Dudek
Password:Dudek2020

School Name: V-0200-02.hs.district128.org

I contacted my mentor and I can use the built-in micrsoft remote desktop connection using either teamviewer or built-in desktop viewer.

Oct. 15th 

I worked on my writeups for the week and I have tried to connect using remote desktop, however I need to make some changes to my permissions on my own computer at my house.

I made changes to the permissions of my computer and I have connected remotely from another computer in my house.

Oct. 16th

I went to IT today and talked about the remote connection from the school computer because it did not allow me to connect remotely to my PC.
