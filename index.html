    <h3>- Network Reference Models  -Finished</h3>

        <p>-I learned the layers in the TCP/IP and OSP models and how they can be used to represent order in which items are sent and received over the internet</p>
        <p>-The TCP/IP model consists of 7 layers of sending and receiving packets</p>
        <p>-The OSP model is a more condensed version of TCP/IP model consisting of only 4 layers</p>
        <p>-The exact same steps are followed in the sending and receiving of packets, except the order changes</p>
        <p>-Lab finished</p>

            <h2>Mentorship Analysis:</h2>
            
            <h3>Mentor Contact Reflection:</h3>

            <h3>What was the first question you asked your mentor this week?</h3>

            <p>The first question I asked my mentor this week was whether the current resource I am using is good for getting the certification in cybersecurity. However, I later found out the answer to my planned first question because John has a CompTIA Security+ sy0-701 certification.</p>

            <h3>ummarize the response from your mentor and analyze how it helps you improve your project. Did it address the challenge? What actions did you take based on the feedback?</h3>

            <p>The response from my mentor helped me improve my project because I got some valuable feedback about the certification I should to take and the resources I should be using. I didn't think my question about whether or not he was certified in cybersecurity was as important as which resources I should or should not be using.</p>

            <h3>Follow-up: How did you use your mentor's guidance to progress in your project? Document how you applied the advice or plan to in the coming week.</h3>

            <p>I used my mentor's guidance to adjust my project goal from getting a certification for certified in cybersecurity to getting a CompTIA Security+ certification because it is the benchmark for many security positions in the field.</p>

            <h3>Challenges:</h3>

            <p>I thought I could complete the course in 60 days, however I did not take any of the suggested prerequisite courses before Security+. I will probably be missing certain information and I will need extra time during the course to learn it. My mentor suggested a timeframe longer than 60 days if possible to make sure I know all the content before taking the exam.</p>

            <img src="unit 7 pic2.png" alt="unit 7 pic2">

            <h3>Timeline:</h3>

            <p>I plan to complete the course in about 90-120 days for newer students. This means I should do 30-45 minutes of the course per day, and I should also save some time at the end of class for documentation of work.  I will take a test at the end of the course and it will give me a score that either qualifies me for the certification or doesn't.</p>
